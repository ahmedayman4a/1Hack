## What is onehack.us ?
1Hack is forum where everyone can share knowledge with each other. There are alot of tutorials, guides and articles for free. Sometimes there are giveaways ,too :wink:
## What is this application then?
It is a way of keeping you connected to the forum. All you have to do is click on the shortcut on your desktop and you get all the new guides , tutorials and tools we developed just for you.
## How to install?
### Windows
Go to the [releases section](https://github.com/ahmedayman4a/1Hack/releases) and download the latest .exe setup file.

* If you have windows smart screen enabled it will tell you not to trust this app , just click run anyway , this is because this app isn't EV CodeSigned which would cost at least 200$ a year. So I either buy this codesigning certifcate (which I can't afford) or this app gets a lot of installs as smart screen is a reputation based system.
